# 2019 solutions in (Stable) Rust

For each day you can:

* Run the program with my puzzle input:
  `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`
* Run the program with other inputs:
  `cargo run -- --input path/to/your/input/file.txt`
* Run tests (for most days these will be the official examples):
  `cargo test`
* Run benchmarks:
  `cargo +nightly bench --features unstable`
